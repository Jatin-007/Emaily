# Emaily
Emaily is an application for small businesses where they can register their accounts, pay some bucks to get credits, enough to send feedback email to a large set of users. The users will be able to open the link in an instinct after the email is sent and can provide an appropriate feedback on the small businesses. 

## Technologies planned to use ?
 1. Node.js with Express library at the backend
 2. React and Redux on front-end using Materialize.css for UI
 3. Google's OAuth with Passport.js for authentication
 4. Stripe library for amazing payment method 
 5. MongoDB for database with Mongoose.js

Thanks for having a look :) 

If you would like to make any suggestions regarding adding more functionalities or libraries, please feel free to send me an email. :D
