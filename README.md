Working on improving Full-Stack development skills.
Planned to create an email feedback application sending users an email to visit the link and provide a feedback also implementing a
Payment method for hands-on for future projects

Technologies planned to use ?
1. Node.js with Express library at the backend
2. React and Redux on front-end
3. Google's OAuth with Passport.js for authentication
4. Stripe library for amazing payment method 
5. MongoDB for database with Mongoose.js

Thanks for having a look :) 
If you would like to make any suggestions regarding adding more functionalities or libraries, please feel free to send me an email. :D
